- Source: https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/peanut-butter-cup-protein-bars/
- Yield: 10 bars
- Prep Time: 10 minutes
- Chill Time: 30 minutes
- Total Time: 40 minutes

## Ingredients (metric)

- 192g natural creamy peanut butter (just peanuts + salt)
- 84g honey (or coconut palm syrup, if vegan)
- 14g melted coconut oil
- 5g vanilla extract
- 40g ground flaxseed meal
- 40g vanilla or plain protein powder (your favorite brand)
- 71g 85% dark chocolate bar
- Coarse sea salt, for sprinkling on top

## Instructions

1) In a medium bowl mix together the peanut butter, honey, melted coconut oil, and vanilla until smooth.
2) Add the ground flaxseed meal and protein powder. Use a spoon to mix until it becomes difficult, then use clean hands to work everything together until the batter resembles cookie dough.
3) Press the mixture into an 8×4 inch pan lined with parchment paper, forming an even layer.
4) Make the chocolate layer by melting the dark chocolate in a small saucepan until completely smooth. Pour the melted chocolate over the peanut butter layer and tilt the pan so the chocolate fully covers the top.
5) Place in the fridge for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until set. Slice into 10 bars or squares and store covered in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

## Notes

- If the batter feels too dry, add ½–1 tablespoon (about 7–14g) of melted virgin coconut oil to help it come together.
- For the protein powder, you can use plant-based or whey protein. The author especially recommends Vital Proteins collagen peptides (dairy free) or Aloha vanilla plant-based protein powder for best flavor and consistency.
