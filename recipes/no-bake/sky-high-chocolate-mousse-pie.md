- Chill Time: 4 hours
- Total Time: 4 hours 55 minutes

## Ingredients (metric)

### Oreo Crust
- 22 regular Oreo cookies (not Double Stuf)
- 71g unsalted butter, melted

### Chocolate Mousse Layer
- 226g unsweetened chocolate, finely chopped (two 4-ounce bars, 100% cacao)
- 28g unsalted butter
- 4 large egg whites (120g)
- 200g granulated sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 480g heavy cream, cold
- 6 whole Oreos, crushed into crumbs (68g)

### Whipped Cream Topping
- 240g heavy cream, cold
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- Optional: chocolate curls or shavings for topping

## Instructions

1) **Make the crust:** Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). In a food processor or blender, pulse 22 Oreos (including the cream filling) into fine crumbs. Pour the crumbs into a medium bowl. Add the melted butter and stir to combine. The mixture will be thick and quite wet. Try to smash/break up any large chunks. Pour the mixture into an ungreased 9-inch pie dish. With medium pressure using your hand, pat the crumbs down into the bottom and up the sides to make a compact, thick crust. Bake for 10 minutes, and then place on a cooling rack to cool completely.

2) **Make the chocolate mousse layer:** Microwave the chopped chocolate and butter together in a large heat-proof bowl, stopping and stirring every 20 seconds until completely melted. Set aside.

3) **Make the meringue for the mousse layer:** Place the egg whites, sugar, and cream of tartar in a heat-proof bowl or the upper pot of a double boiler. Set bowl over a saucepan filled with 2 inches of simmering water. Do not let the bowl touch the water. Whisking constantly, cook the egg white mixture until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture reaches 160°F (71°C) on an instant-read thermometer.

4) Transfer the mixture to a heat-safe bowl (if using a hand mixer) or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on high speed until soft, glossy peaks form, about 5-6 minutes. Gently fold the melted chocolate into the egg white mixture until combined. Wash the mixer bowl and whisk attachment clean.

5) **Make the whipped cream for the mousse layer:** Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream on medium-high speed until medium-to-stiff peaks form, about 3-4 minutes. Gently fold whipped cream into the chocolate mixture. It may seem like a lot of whipped cream, but just keep folding and it will eventually come together. Do not over-mix; it will deflate the mousse. (No need to wash or wipe the bowl/whisk attachment clean—you'll make sweetened whipped cream in step 7.)

6) Using a small offset spatula, spread half of the mousse in the cooled pie crust. Sprinkle the crushed cookie crumbs evenly over the top. Top with the remaining chocolate mousse, mounding it in the center to create a dome shape. Place the pie in the refrigerator while you prepare the sweetened whipped cream topping.

7) **Make the whipped cream topping:** Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 3 minutes. You want the peaks to be somewhat soft so the whipped cream spreads nicely on the mousse.

8) Remove the pie from the refrigerator and spread the whipped cream on top—keeping that dome shape in the center. Top with chocolate shavings, if using. Refrigerate the pie, uncovered, for at least 4 hours or up to 1 day. Let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

## Notes

- **Make Ahead:** Since this pie needs to chill for several hours or overnight, it's perfect for making a day or two ahead of time. Carefully cover it if refrigerating for longer than 1 day.
- **Egg Whites:** The egg whites are gently cooked to 160°F (71°C), which is considered safe to eat. You can use a candy thermometer or instant-read thermometer to determine their temperature. You can use pasteurized egg whites, though keep in mind they may never reach the volume of unpasteurized egg whites.
- **Cream of Tartar:** Key for stabilizing those egg whites.
- **Unsweetened Chocolate:** Look for this in the baking aisle near the chocolate chips. Baking chocolate is typically sold in 4-ounce bars. Pick up the bars labeled 100% cacao, or unsweetened chocolate. Ghirardelli and Baker's brands work well.
- **Gluten-Free:** Use gluten-free Oreos for a gluten-free dessert.
- **Pie Crust Alternative:** For a traditional crust, use a fully blind baked pie crust instead of the Oreo crust. The baked pie shell must cool completely before adding the chocolate mousse filling.
- **Chocolate Curls:** Run a vegetable peeler down the long side of a Hershey's milk chocolate bar, or use chocolate sprinkles, mini chocolate chips, fresh raspberries, or more Oreo crumbs.
- **Comparison to French Silk Pie:** This sky-high chocolate mousse pie is lighter and less sweet, made with an Oreo crust and an airy mousse structured with cooked egg whites and whipped cream. French Silk Pie is richer and sweeter, built on a traditional pastry pie crust with a velvety filling made from whole eggs and plenty of butter.

## Storage

- Fridge: up to 4 days, covered
- Freezer: up to 3 months (the pie won't be quite as beautiful after freezing, but it's a great way to store leftovers; thaw overnight in the refrigerator before enjoying, or enjoy frozen)
