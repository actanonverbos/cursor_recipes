- Yield: 12 slices (6 servings)
- Prep Time: 15 minutes
- Cook Time: 15 minutes
- Total Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients (metric)

- 1 (400g) ciabatta loaf, sliced in half lengthwise
- 28g salted butter, at room temperature
- 60g mayonnaise
- 15-30g calabrian chili paste, depending on your spice preference
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 115g shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 50g pitted castelvetrano olives, roughly chopped
- 50g pitted kalamata olives, roughly chopped
- 25g freshly grated parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley

## Instructions

1) Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and place ciabatta halves cut side-up.

2) In a small mixing bowl, add the softened butter, mayonnaise, calabrian chili paste, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to mix until well combined.

3) Spread the butter mixture between each half of the bread and use a rubber spatula to spread it out evenly to the edges of the bread. Top with the mozzarella cheese, then a mix of the chopped castelvetrano and kalamata olives. Grate on the parmesan cheese.

4) Bake for 15-20 minutes until the cheese is melted and beginning to turn golden brown. Place the bread on a cutting board and cut each half-loaf crosswise into 6 pieces so you have 12 pieces total. Top with a sprinkle of chopped parsley and serve immediately!

## Notes

- Recipe inspired by Pioneer Woman's Olive Cheese Bread.
- Not into spice? Feel free to reduce or omit the calabrian chili paste. The chili paste is spicy, but it's more of a warm heat with a slightly fruity flavor (rather than a burn-your-tongue chili pepper spice).
- For softer bread, cover the bread halves in foil before baking and/or reduce the baking time by 1-2 minutes.
- For crispier bread, leave it in the oven for 1-2 minutes extra. Just watch it carefully so that the cheese doesn't burn.
- To make gluten-free: use your favorite loaf of gluten-free bread.
- To make dairy-free: use vegan butter, vegan mayo, and your favorite dairy-free/vegan cheese shreds for topping.

## Storage

- Best eaten the day of, but you can store any leftovers covered at room temperature for about 1 day.
- Fridge: After 1 day, store the bread in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
- Reheat: Wrap in foil and warm for 10 minutes at 350°F (175°C).
