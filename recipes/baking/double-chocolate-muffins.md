- Yield: 14 muffins
- Prep Time: 10 minutes
- Total Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients (metric)

- 250g all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
- 200g granulated sugar
- 41g unsweetened natural cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 315g semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 185g full fat sour cream or plain yogurt, at room temperature
- 120ml vegetable oil
- 120ml whole milk, at room temperature
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

## Instructions

1) Preheat oven to 218°C (425°F). Spray a 12-count muffin pan with nonstick spray or use cupcake liners. This recipe yields about 14 muffins, so prepare a second muffin pan in the same manner or bake in batches and reserve leftover batter at room temperature for when the first batch is done.

2) Whisk the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chips together in a large bowl. Set aside.

3) Whisk the eggs, sour cream, oil, milk, and vanilla extract together until combined.

4) Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and fold together with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon until completely combined. The batter will be thick and sticky. Avoid overmixing.

5) Spoon the batter into liners, filling them all the way to the top.

6) Bake for 5 minutes at 218°C (425°F) then, keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce the oven temperature to 177°C (350°F). Bake for an additional 15-16 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The total time these muffins take in the oven is about 20-21 minutes.

7) Cool muffins for 10 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack until ready to eat.

## Notes

- Use unsweetened natural cocoa powder for best results. Dutch process cocoa can be used but the muffins may not rise as much
- Sour cream is key to keeping the muffins moist and giving them the perfect texture. You can substitute with plain yogurt (full fat Greek or regular is best)
- Use vegetable oil, not melted butter, as cocoa powder is very drying and oil keeps the muffins moist
- Bring eggs, milk, and sour cream to room temperature before starting to avoid overmixing
- Mix the chocolate chips into the dry ingredients to avoid overmixing the final batter
- The high initial oven temperature (425°F/218°C) gives the muffins tall, bakery-style tops
- These muffins are best served warm with melty chocolate chips
- For jumbo muffins: Use a 6-count jumbo muffin pan, bake for 5 minutes at 218°C (425°F), then reduce to 177°C (350°F) and bake for an additional 25-28 minutes
- For mini muffins: Bake 13-14 total minutes at 177°C (350°F) the whole time

## Storage
