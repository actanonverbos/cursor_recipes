- Yield: 18 cupcakes
- Prep Time: 20 minutes
- Total Time: 2 hours (including baking and cooling)

## Ingredients (metric)

### Cupcakes

- 250g all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
- 5g baking soda
- 2g baking powder
- 5g ground cinnamon
- 4g salt
- 113g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 100g packed light or dark brown sugar
- 100g granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 60g sour cream or plain yogurt, at room temperature
- 10g pure vanilla extract
- 345g mashed bananas (about 4 medium or 3 large ripe bananas)
- 120ml buttermilk, at room temperature

### Cinnamon Cream Cheese Frosting

- 226g full-fat brick cream cheese, softened to room temperature
- 113g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 360g confectioners' sugar (plus extra 30g if needed for thicker consistency)
- 5g pure vanilla extract
- 2g ground cinnamon
- 1g salt
- Optional: banana slices and/or crushed Nilla Wafer cookies for garnish

## Instructions

1) Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners and a second pan with 6 liners (or bake in batches)—this recipe makes about 18 cupcakes. Set aside.

2) Make the cupcakes: Whisk the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Set aside.

3) Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar on medium-high speed until creamed together, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed.

4) Add the eggs, sour cream/yogurt, and vanilla extract, then beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Beat in the mashed banana.

5) With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in the buttermilk until combined. Do not overmix. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no dry flour pockets at the bottom of the bowl.

6) Pour/spoon the batter into the liners—fill only 2/3 full to avoid spilling over the sides. Bake for 18–20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. (For about 36 mini cupcakes, bake for about 11–13 minutes at the same oven temperature.)

7) Cool the cupcakes in the pan set on a cooling rack for 20 minutes, then remove them from the pan and return to the rack to cool completely before frosting.

8) Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on high speed until smooth and creamy.

9) Add 360g confectioners' sugar, the vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then gradually increase the speed to high and beat for 2 minutes. If you want the frosting a little thicker, add the extra 30g of confectioners' sugar.

10) To help ensure the frosting holds piped shape, refrigerate the bowl of frosting for at least 20 minutes. Frost cooled cupcakes using a piping tip (such as Ateco #826 or #808) or use a knife or icing spatula to spread on the frosting.

11) Garnish with banana slices and crushed Nilla Wafer cookies, if desired.

## Notes

- **Easy Mash:** Mash the bananas using your mixer by placing peeled bananas in the mixing bowl and turning the mixer on to medium-high speed. A blender or food processor also works. Transfer the mashed bananas to a separate bowl before continuing with the recipe.
- **Don't Overfill:** Fill cupcake liners only 2/3 full to avoid the batter spilling over the sides and baking into mushroom tops.
- **Room Temperature:** All refrigerated items should be brought to room temperature so the batter mixes together easily and evenly.
- **Frozen Bananas:** You can use thawed frozen bananas in this recipe. Drain off as much of the excess liquid as you can before mashing. The riper the banana, the better—use brown, spotty super-ripe ones for best flavor.
- **Buttermilk Substitute:** If you don't have buttermilk, add 5ml (1 teaspoon) of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup, then add enough whole milk to reach 120ml (1/2 cup). Stir and let sit for 5 minutes before using.
- **Alternative Frostings:** Traditional vanilla buttercream, chocolate buttercream, Nutella frosting, peanut butter frosting, salted caramel frosting, or chai spice buttercream frosting all pair beautifully with banana cupcakes.

## Storage

- Fridge: Cover leftover cupcakes tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Use a cupcake carrier for storing and transporting decorated cupcakes.
- Freezer: Frosted or unfrosted cupcakes can be frozen for up to 2–3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator.
- Make Ahead: Cupcakes can be made ahead 1 day in advance, covered, and stored at room temperature. Frosting can also be made 1 day in advance, covered, and stored in the refrigerator until ready to use.
