# My Favorite Banana Bread

- Source: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/best-banana-bread-recipe/
- Yield: 1 loaf (9x5-inch)
- Prep Time: 10 minutes
- Total Time: 1 hour 15 minutes

## Ingredients (metric)

- 250g all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
- 5g (1 teaspoon) baking soda
- 1g (1/4 teaspoon) salt
- 2g (1/2 teaspoon) ground cinnamon
- 113g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 150g packed light or dark brown sugar
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 80g plain Greek yogurt or full-fat sour cream, at room temperature
- 345g mashed bananas (about 3-4 ripe bananas)
- 5ml (1 teaspoon) pure vanilla extract
- Optional: 90g chopped pecans or walnuts, or 180g semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1) Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Lowering the oven rack prevents the top of your bread from browning too much, too soon. Grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray. Set aside.

2) In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together. Set aside.

3) In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on medium-high speed until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. With the mixer running on medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the yogurt, vanilla, and mashed bananas until combined.

4) Add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and beat on low speed just until combined. Do not over-mix. Fold in the nuts/chocolate chips, if using. The batter should be thick.

5) Pour and spread the batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 60–65 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the pan with aluminum foil halfway through, to prevent the top from getting too brown. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with only a few small moist crumbs.

6) Cool the bread in the pan set on a cooling rack for 1 hour. Remove the bread from the pan and cool it directly on the rack until ready to slice and serve.

## Notes

- You can use your electric mixer to mash bananas: Break or slice the spotty bananas into large pieces and place in the bowl of your stand mixer. Begin beating on low, then gradually increase to medium-high speed as the bananas break down into mashed banana.
- If needed, you can use salted butter in this recipe with no other changes needed. The butter can also be reduced down to 85g with no issue.
- This is not an overly sweet quick bread. If you want a sweeter banana bread, increase to 200g brown sugar.
- For banana nut bread, add 90g of chopped nuts (pecans or walnuts) to the batter.
- For banana bread muffins, this recipe makes 15 muffins. Bake for 5 minutes at 425°F (218°C), then reduce to 350°F (177°C) and bake for an additional 16-17 minutes.
- If you don't have sour cream or yogurt, you can use 80g mashed banana (in addition to what is called for), unsweetened applesauce, or canned pumpkin puree.
- You can use frozen bananas. Thaw the frozen bananas at room temperature, drain off any excess liquid, mash, then use as instructed.
- Tastes best on day 2!
