- Yield: 1 loaf (serves 8-10)
- Prep Time: 15 minutes (plus 15+ hours rising/resting time)
- Total Time: 16 hours 10 minutes

## Ingredients (metric)

### Pizza Bread

- 440g bread flour (spooned & leveled), plus more for shaping
- 2 teaspoons instant or active dry yeast
- 2 teaspoons coarse salt
- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
- 135g chopped pepperoni, sun-dried tomatoes (packed in oil & drained), and/or olives (about 1 heaping cup)
- 113g shredded mozzarella cheese
- 360ml water, close to room temperature at about 21°C (70°F)

### Optional Hot Honey Butter

- 113g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 3 tablespoons (63g) honey
- 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
- 1/8–1/4 teaspoon flaky sea salt or coarse salt
- pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, to taste

## Instructions

1) In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, salt, sugar, oregano, basil, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper (if using). Using a silicone spatula or wooden spoon, mix in the chopped add-ins (pepperoni, sun-dried tomatoes, olives) and mozzarella cheese. Pour in the water and gently mix together. The dough will seem dry and shaggy, but keep working it until all the flour is moistened. If needed, use your hands to work the dough ingredients together until all the flour is moistened. The dough will be sticky. Shape into a ball in the bowl as best you can.

2) Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and set on the counter at room temperature. Allow to rise for 3 hours. The dough will just about double in size, stick to the sides of the bowl, and have a lot of air bubbles. Place the risen dough, still covered, in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours and up to 3 days. The dough will puff up during this time, but may begin to deflate after 2 days. That's normal.

3) Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and, using generously floured hands, shape into a ball as best you can. It doesn't have to be perfect. Transfer the dough to a large piece of parchment paper. Place the ball of dough + parchment inside a medium-size mixing bowl so the dough doesn't spread out as it rests. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes.

4) During this rest, preheat the oven to 232°C (450°F). Place a 6-quart or larger Dutch oven (with the lid) or heavy-duty pot in the oven for 30 minutes so that it's extremely hot before the dough is placed inside.

5) After 30 minutes, using a very sharp knife or bread lame, score the dough with an X, about 1/2 inch deep. Remove the Dutch oven from the oven and carefully place the scored dough inside by lifting it up with the parchment paper and placing it all—the parchment paper included—inside the pot. Cover with the lid.

6) Bake for 25 minutes with the lid on. Carefully remove the lid and continue baking for around 10–15 minutes more until the bread is golden brown. The bread is done when an instant-read thermometer reads the center of the loaf as 90°C (195°F), or when the warm bread sounds hollow when tapped.

7) Remove pot from the oven, carefully remove the bread from the pot, and allow to cool on a cooling rack for at least 20 minutes before slicing. Because of the heavy add-ins and cheese, this bread is flatter than most boules. Slice and serve with homemade hot honey butter, if desired.

8) Make the hot honey butter (optional): In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the remaining ingredients, starting with only 1/8 teaspoon of salt and a small pinch of red pepper flakes. Beat on medium-high speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula and beat again as needed to combine. Taste. Add more salt and/or crushed red pepper flakes if desired.

## Notes

- This is a no-knead bread recipe that requires no mixer and minimal hands-on time—90% of the process is hands-off rising and resting
- The dough rests and rises overnight in the refrigerator, which develops better flavor through slow fermentation
- Bread flour is strongly recommended for the best texture and chewiness. All-purpose flour can be substituted 1:1 if needed, but avoid whole wheat flour as it will make the bread extremely dense
- Use coarse salt rather than table salt for better flavor. If using fine salt, reduce to 1 and 1/2 teaspoons
- Instant yeast (rapid rise or quick rise) is recommended for faster rising, but active dry yeast works too (rise time may be longer)
- Use cool or room-temperature water (around 21°C/70°F), not warm water
- For the mix-ins, use about 1 heaping cup total of your favorite pizza toppings. The crowd favorite combination is pepperoni, sun-dried tomatoes, and olives, but you can substitute with cooked sausage, caramelized onions, diced ham, or roasted red peppers
- Either shredded mozzarella or diced fresh mozzarella works well
- You can use 2–3 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano/basil instead of dried, or 2 teaspoons minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder
- Honey can be substituted for the sugar—whisk it into the water instead of mixing into dry ingredients
- If using dried herbs: oregano and basil add pizza-style flavor. Fresh herbs can be substituted
- Add crushed red pepper flakes to taste for pizzeria-style heat

## Baking Without a Dutch Oven

### Baking Sheet Method:
Place the shaped dough on a parchment-lined or generously floured (or cornmeal-dusted) baking sheet in step 3, cover, and let rest for 30 minutes. While the oven preheats (step 4), bring a kettle of water to a boil. Once the dough is scored (step 5), place the baking sheet on the center rack and a shallow metal pan (not glass) on the bottom rack. Carefully pour 3–4 cups of boiling water into the pan to create steam, then quickly shut the oven door. The steam helps give the bread a crisper crust. Bake for around 35–38 minutes and check for doneness with an instant-read thermometer (90°C/195°F internal temperature).

### Pizza Stone or Cast Iron Skillet (25-30cm/10-12 inch):
You can preheat the stone or cast iron skillet in the oven in step 4 for a slightly crisper crust (or skip preheating if you prefer) and you can also add steam to the oven, as described in the baking sheet method. After scoring the dough in step 5, transfer it (on parchment, since the dough is very sticky) onto the hot stone or skillet. Bake as directed, but note that the bread may finish a little faster, so keep an eye on it and check for doneness with an instant-read thermometer.

## Serving Suggestions

- Warm marinara sauce or pizza sauce for dipping
- Tomato soup or minestrone soup
- Flavorful dipping oil: Mix 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil with 2 minced garlic cloves plus a sprinkle each of red pepper flakes, fresh or dried thyme leaves, dried oregano, salt, and pepper
- Hot honey butter (recipe included above)

## Storage

- Room temperature: loosely covered for up to 3 days
- Refrigerator: up to 1 week, covered
- Freezer: Baked bread can be tightly wrapped and frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before serving
- Freezer (dough): Complete recipe through step 2, wrap in plastic wrap and place in a freezer-friendly container or zip-top bag. Freeze for up to 3 months. To bake, thaw overnight in the refrigerator or for 2–3 hours at room temperature, then continue with step 3
- Hot honey butter: Store tightly covered at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 2–3 months (can be frozen for up to 6 months)

## Make Ahead Instructions

The dough can sit in the refrigerator for up to 3 days after the initial 3-hour room temperature rise, making this a wonderful recipe to begin ahead of time. The longer rest time (up to 3 days) can even improve the flavor.
